Lessons Learned:

Describe project experience including each phase of the SDLC and the project artifacts (design documents, requirements trace, test reports...)

- What did you do right?

Most of my project came little by little and by trial and error. I consistently got things wrong over and over, googled, watched YouTube videos or reached out to classmates to get back on track, and gradually made it to get my project to MVP status.

- What did you do wrong?

Coming into this program, I had no idea what we would learn so I brainstormed an idea that I eventually had to trim down a bit. Through each phase of the SDLC, I found myself having to dial back the scope of my project or modify my original ideas for my database schema, my ERD, my requirements, etc… There are still many aspects that need work, and now that I have a better grasp of requirements gathering and have, for lack of a better term, “seen how the sausage is made” I can go forward with new projects more confidently and accurately.

- Where were you lucky?

I got lucky often with my views. I relied heavily on Bootstrap and intend on getting more into styling as I go further into software development.

- What would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?

Just about everything. I feel like I made almost every mistake you could make. Often, we would go over things in class that I couldn’t fully comprehend and then a week or two later, I would enmeshed in the exact topic we had discussed. It was frustrating, but I feel like that is one of the most effective ways to reinforce concepts. There is something about “man, I should’ve paid better attention.” That really drives home comprehension for me.
